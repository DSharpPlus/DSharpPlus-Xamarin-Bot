# Portable Companion Cube

This is an example DSharpPlus bot, based on Xamarin.Android.

This is a very basic bot, but it should give you a good idea of where to start.

## How to run the bot?

In order to run the bot, you must first create an application for it, build the bot, then configure it.

### Create the application

1. Go to [my applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) page on Discord Developer portal.
2. Press the [**new app** button](http://i.imgur.com/IVsPyNw.png).
3. [**New app** page](http://i.imgur.com/3mrEG9x.png) will open. Enter your bot's name in the **app name** field (1), and its description in the **description** field (2).
   * You can optionally give it an avatar by pressing on the **avatar** button (3).
4. When you're done, press the [**create app** button](http://i.imgur.com/ur3HFng.png).
5. When the app is created, press the [**create bot user** button](http://i.imgur.com/b69CHy7.png).
6. Once this is done, you will need to copy the **bot's token**. Under **app bot user**, there's a **token** field, press [**click to reveal**](http://i.imgur.com/00b4Nt8.png) and copy [**the resulting value**](http://i.imgur.com/Lt2uhcN.png).

### Building the project and configuring the bot

1. Open the project, and compile it in **Debug** mode.
2. Install the app on your device.

### Adding the bot to your server

1. Go back to your app page, and copy your bot's [**client ID**](http://i.imgur.com/NuAPpoY.png).
2. Go to `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your_app_id_here&scope=bot&permissions=0`.
3. On the [page](http://i.imgur.com/QeH0o5S.png), select **your server** (1), and press **authorize** (2).
4. [Done](http://i.imgur.com/LF1gpm2.png)! You can now run the bot!

### Running the bot

Now start **Companion Cube Portable** app on your device or from the debugger.
